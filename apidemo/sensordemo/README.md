Glass Development Kit - Sensor Demos
=======

Sensors can be classfied into three categories:
Motion sensors, position sensors, and environmetnal sensors.
The "demo apps" in this directory includes sample code 
showing the simple use of these sensors on Glass.

## Motion Sensor Demo

This simple Glassware uses a "demo app framework",
which displays dynamic sensor data on a live card.
The app "listens" to five motion sensors:
* Accelerometer
* Gravity sensor
* Linear acceleration
* Gyroscope
* Rotation vector

You can start the app through the following voice trigger.
