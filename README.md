## LiveCard Demo

This Glassware demonstrates a simple implementation of the 
[LiveCard](https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/ui/live-cards) API.

It creates a LiveCard when the app's main activity is first activated (through voice input).
The lifecycle of the LiveCard is associated with that of a background `Service` (.service.LiveDemoLocalService).

It also shows how to add a menu to a LiveCard, 
which is bound to the main activity.
